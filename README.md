# BusMall Market Analysis App

#### By Cari Palazzolo / @caripizza

## Description
In this lab, I'm building an app for a small startup called BusMall- a magazine producer similar to SkyMall. Their catalogs are placed on regional transit buses with long travel times (and thus lots of time for perusing enticing products).

Before the catalog of products can be printed, BusMall needs marketing analysis to determine which products are most desireable and need to be included in the magazine.

The app will display images of potential products to individuals in a focus group, in order to test their potential customer appeal. The focus group users will choose one product out of a set of three, until they have made 25 image selections. As they progress through the app it will store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data. After completion the focus group user will see their survey results, showing a breakdown of their votes/image selections.

## Data to consider:
- Total number of clicks
- Total number of times each image displays
- Percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown

## Initial work:
* Write user stories: `"As a x, I want y, so that z."`
    - Roles:
        1) Marketing team, in need of data
            - Unique perspectives per team member
        2) Focus group user, using app
            - Different perspectives per user
* Create UI mockup
* Determine component architecture

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* TBD...

## Technologies Used

* Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
